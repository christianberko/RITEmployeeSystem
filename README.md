# RITEmployeeSystem
A database application for fostering collaboration among faculty, students, and the community. The system allows:

Faculty: Manage research abstracts, interests, and search for students with matching research topics.
Students: Search faculty by research interests to find capstone/thesis sponsors.
Public: Search for faculty or students for workshops and presentations.

Built with a MySQL database, a Java-based backend, and a GUI frontend, the project promotes professional connections within and outside the iSchool.
