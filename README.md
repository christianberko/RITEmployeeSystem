A database application designed to foster collaboration among faculty, students, and the community. The system allows:

Faculty: Manage research abstracts and interests, and search for students with matching research topics.
Students: Search faculty by research interests to find capstone/thesis sponsors.
Public: Search for faculty or students for workshops and presentations.
Built with a MySQL database, a Java-based backend, and a GUI frontend, the project promotes professional connections within and outside the iSchool.

My contributions focused on developing many of the core classes and logic that directly interact with the MySQL database.
I implemented data access layers, designed efficient queries, and ensured seamless communication between the backend and the database.
My work enabled dynamic searches, robust data management, and accurate information retrieval throughout the application.
